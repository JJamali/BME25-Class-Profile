This is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) project that uses the libraries [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

## Getting started
There are a couple of sections to this project. 

### Data Cleaning with Pandas
Input: Raw data in .csv file
Output: Cleaned relavent data in .csv

### Plotting with matplotlib
Input: .csv file
Output: Many graphs and plots showing correlation and other values 
- plotting against different columns
- own plot 

#### Analysis
Take a look at the plots and correlations between each variable and determine if they are relavent and/or good findings. 
Present them in a nice format to the group
